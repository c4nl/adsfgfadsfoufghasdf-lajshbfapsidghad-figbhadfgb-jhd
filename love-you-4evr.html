            baby i mean it when i say this aswell and i put it on everything. i was not in a call with anyone else other than you, you asked me to leave my mic unmuted when i do it cuz u wanted a behind the scene, i promise you on my life that there is no1 else why would i record myself cumming to someone else and then send it to you, my only other explanation for that sound is that you were moving around because my phone does pick that up it is close enough to pick it up. i will give u the login to everything i have if you do not bealive me because i fucking promise on my own life that i wasnt doing it with someone. i left my pc and got in bed and decided to record it for you, i recorded it for you then after i instantly went to just take a shower to wash myself, after i washed myself i went straight to school so i dont know even how to explain and prove that there is no one else all i can really do is give you everything u want to see and u bealive what u want but i promise you on my whole life, on my familys life there is no1 else and the only other explanation is that its you moving in call, i know you probably dont give 2 fucks abt what i wrote here and prob wont even bealive me but thats the only explanation i can acc give to why that sound is in the video because i sweat to god on everything you were moving alot even when i just got in bed u were moving, but i promise on everything that i own and love that there is no one else and it only comes back to one explanation that its you inhaling/exhaling then moving. im just sorry that i acted like that when we tried to talk abt it cuz i know i seemed worked up and thats because i didnt want you to leave me over something i didnt even know was in there and it just hurts me that idk how to explain it and stuff becuase i seriously didnt watch through the video when i sent it. i never rlly do, i will record it then send it to you instantly after so idk why/who/what/how that is in the video and my only other explanation is that you were moving around and breathing. thats the only thing i can think of making sense in the context w that video, im just sorry and dont know how to explain it. i love you so much just please understand that there is a 99.99% chance that its you moving around in the video because i promise on everything i wont/havent cheated on you ever. we both know i couldnt make myself do it even if u allowed me to, i love you so much and im so sorry that i cant explain it, there isnt really anything to even explain because only thing that i remember happening in that video was you in call w me n my deafened alt on youtube watching charlie. i love you so much and im sorry that i seemed so worked up about it im just really scared of losing you, you mean everything to me baby and i love you so much
